# Oceanic Viral DNA Biologic Pathway Analysis
522 lab 1 project

Question: Does the average amount of viral and bacterial DNA from the ocean differ across 9 different biological pathways they are involved in and across five different depths? This is an inferential question, as we are using a dataset that has 300 ocean samples taken from all over the world, and we are making an inference about the ocean's viral and bacterial populations.

We got the dataset from the taracyc ocean project, and the data is publically acessible on this website http://oganm.com/shiny/taracyc/

Plan of Action
We will be doing a hypothesis test using a 2-way ANOVA, with the following hypotheses.

- Null Hyothesis: The mean DNA abundance levels are the same for each depth and pathway. 
- Alternate Hypothesis: The mean DNA abundance levels are not the same for each depth and pathway.

We will be showcasing the results of our hypothesis test in a table with the mean values for each group, and the MSerror, SSerror, alpha, and the F-statistic. We may also show some visual plots of the analysis with box plots and jitter for each category.

## Plan of Action

We will be doing a hypothesis test using a 2-way ANOVA, with the following hypotheses.

$Ho=$ The mean DNA abundance levels are the same for each depth and pathway.
$Ha=$  The mean DNA abundance levels are not the same for each depth and pathway.

We will be showcasing the results of our hypothesis test in a table with the mean values for each group, and the MS, SS, and the F-statistic. We may also show some visual plots of the analysis with box plots and jitter for each category.
