Question: Do the biological pathways differ across amount of viral DNA and depth?
This is an inferential question.

We got the dataset from the taracyc ocean project, and the data is publically acessible on this website http://oganm.com/shiny/taracyc/

## Plan of Action

We will be doing a hypothesis test using a 2-way ANOVA, with the following hypotheses.

$Ho=$ The mean DNA abundance levels are the same for each depth and pathway.
$Ha=$  The mean DNA abundance levels are not the same for each depth and pathway.

We will be showcasing the results of our hypothesis test in a table with the mean values for each group, and the MS, SS, and the F-statistic. We may also show some visual plots of the analysis with box plots and jitter for each category.
